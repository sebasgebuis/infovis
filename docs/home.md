## Research Subject: Diversity of popular music
Different generations often clash heads on lots of topics. Music is no exception to this.
Older generations often claim that music sounds the same nowadays, back in their time music was unique and special.
Newer generations however claim that music is currently more diverse than ever. 

This brings us to our two standpoints:

<em> Popular songs do not sound the same, diversity in music has increased because of the rise of the internet. </em>

<em> Popular music does sound the same, that is why it is all labeled under one label of "pop music" </em>
